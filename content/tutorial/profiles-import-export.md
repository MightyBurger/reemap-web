# Importing and Exporting Profiles

Reemap lets you export and import files.

## Importing a Profile

Click on **File > Import Profile**. Then, select a profile. Reemap will add it to the profile list.

## Exporting a Profile

Click on **File > Export Profile > *(your profile)***. Then, choose a file to save the profile to.

## Information Stored in Profile Files

Everything you can configure about a profile is stored in this file, including:

- Profile version
- Profile name
- Profile condition
- All the remaps in this profile
- All the layers in this profile
- Which layers are enabled
- Whether to confine the cursor
- Whether the profile is enabled

## Sharing Profiles

When you export a profile, you will get a `.ron` file. This is the file you can send to other people
for them to import.

### Note on Profile Version

The profile version is based on the version of Reemap you are using.
Reemap will automatically upgrade profiles to newer versions, but it can't downgrade profiles to
older versions.
