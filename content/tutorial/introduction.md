# Introduction

This website contains instructions for Reemap, an input remap tool.

## What's it do?

Reemap runs in the background and converts keyboard/mouse inputs to other keyboard/mouse inputs. You
set the remaps you want.

Reemap is designed with video games in mind. It is lightweight and easy on the CPU, and it won't
add input lag. It is carefully designed to avoid problems with keys sticking when you switch layers;
this is a problem some existing remap software suffers from.

Note: Reemap only supports plain input remaps. It does not time inputs or run macros.

## Why's it called that?

Reemap is named after Reem, the spirit in [Ori and the Blind Forest][Ori] whose ancestral
tree grants Bash. Reemap was originally created for the Ori speedrun community.

## How do I use it?

To get started, make a profile, and add some remaps to it!

Reemap has two features to help with remaps: **profiles** and **layers**.

**Profiles** let you apply remaps when a certain window is in focus. For example, you can make
**C** change to **D** when Notepad is open.

Each profile can contain any number of **layers**. Layers give you more options for how to remap
your inputs. Layers are optional, but they can be useful.

At any point in time, only one profile is active. But multiple layers can be active at once.

## The Escape Hatch

If you ever get stuck, **turn on Scroll Lock**. Reemap will stop remapping inputs.
