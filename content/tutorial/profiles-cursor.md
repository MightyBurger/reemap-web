# Confining the Cursor

In a profile menu, there is a checkbox to confine the cursor:

This setting keeps your mouse in the window.

This option is useful if you have multiple monitors and you're playing a game in fullscreen.
Often, you'll want to keep your mouse in the game window so you don't accidentally click away
from the game.

Some games already confine your mouse. Other games, like Ori, don't, so it is helpful to have a tool
like Reemap do it.

It's easy to get stuck with this setting. So as a reminder, you can **enable Scroll Lock** to disable
Reemap.
