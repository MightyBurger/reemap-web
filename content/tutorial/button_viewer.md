# Button Viewer

Some keys may have obscure names. Depending on your keyboard layout, Reemap might even show the
wrong key names.

You can see what Reemap thinks a key or mouse button is called with the Button Viewer tool.

Click on **Tools > Button Viewer**.

To use this tool, **Reemap must be out of focus**. Otherwise, keyboard inputs will not show up.

When you press a button, Reemap will display what it thinks that button is called.
