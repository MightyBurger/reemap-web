# Settings

Click on **File > Settings** to open Reemap settings.

![screenshot](/images/tutorial/open_settings.png)

Currently, there is only one setting: **Show unusual keys**.

## Show unusual keys

Reemap contains every [virtual key code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes),
but many of these key codes aren't on many user's keyboards. Reemap will hide some keys by default, but
you can show these keys by checking this box.[^1]

[^1]: Reemap hides a small number of keys even with this setting enabled. This includes
**Scroll Lock**, which Reemap reserves as the special key to disable remaps.
