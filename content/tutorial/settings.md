# Settings

Click on **File > Settings** to open Reemap settings.

![screenshot](/images/tutorial/open_settings.png)

Reemap has three settings. Like all the profiles, these settings are user-specific. If you make changes to your settings, they will not affect any other users on your computer.

## Background

You can set the background in Reemap to one of two pictures:
- Ginso Tree
- Gradient

This setting has no effect on the function of Reemap.

## Run on login

When checked, Reemap will start when you log in.

Be careful if you have a profile that runs unconditionally. If you get yourself stuck, remember: you can **turn on Scroll Lock** to disable remaps!

## Show unusual keys

Reemap contains every [virtual key code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes),
but many of these key codes aren't on many user's keyboards. Reemap will hide some keys by default, but
you can show these keys by checking this box.

Reemap hides a small number of keys even with this setting enabled. This includes
**Scroll Lock**, which Reemap reserves as the special key to disable remaps.
