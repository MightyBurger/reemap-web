# Profiles

You can add profiles in Reemap.

When you add a profile, Reemap will ask you to choose a window. The profile will be active when the
window is in focus.

Once you make a profile, you can click on it inside Reemap. From there, you can add remaps and
even add some layers.

For example, you might set up a profile that remaps **Right Click** to **C**, but only when Ori is
open.

## Profile Priority

If multiple profiles could apply at the same time, only the one that's higher up in the list of
profiles will be active.

For example, if you have two profiles active when `firefox.exe` is in focus, only the first profile
will apply when Firefox is open.

## Making a Default Profile

Sometimes, it's useful to have a default profile, i.e. a profile that's active when no other
profile is active.

To do this, make the profile **Always Active**, then put it at the *bottom* of the list of profiles.
That way, your other profiles take priority.
