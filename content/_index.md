Reemap is an input remapping tool for Windows. It runs in the background
and remaps keyboard and mouse inputs.

Reemap is named after Reem, the spirit in [Ori and the Blind Forest][Ori] whose ancestral
tree grants Bash.

Reemap was originally developed for [Ori] speedrunners who use input remaps.

# Features

- **Profiles** - remap inputs differently for each program
- **Layers** - conditionally override inputs in a profile
- **Keyboard and mouse** - freely map keyboard inputs to mouse inputs, and vice versa
- **Multi maps** - map one input to multiple outputs
- **Export and import profiles** - share or back up profiles
- **Confine cursor to window** - prevent the mouse from leaving the window (useful for fullscreen
games on multi-monitor setups)

Reemap is a general-purpose remap tool, but it is designed with video games in mind. It is lightweight and easy on the CPU, and it won't
add input lag. It is carefully designed to avoid problems with keys sticking when you switch layers;
this is a problem some existing remap software suffers from.
